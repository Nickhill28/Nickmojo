This project is done as an assignment given by Rentomojo.
In the project I was asked to build a Phonebook webapp in either node.js or PHP.
I've chosed to complete this project with node.js along with express and angular while for the database i've tried hands with mongojs(mongodb).
A simple App with minor complexities works to provide an interface to add,remove,edit,delete and hover the details of the contacts saved.
This app was supposed to be deployed as asked by the assignee, but due to lack of adequate time and shortage of needful knowledge of the process I'm unable to deploy the app for now. I'll be upskilling myself soon and will make this app available in the deployment soon.

Turns out to be a MEAN stack project.
MongoDB: Database
ExpressJS: RESTful API
AngularJS: Presentation
NodeJS: JavaScript Server Side

Learning:
JavaScript
Database concepts
Command Line
API 

Software:
NodeJS
MongoDB
Text Editor (VS Code)

NPM: install
"angular": "^1.7.9"
"body-parser": "^1.19.0"
"express": "^4.17.1"
"mongojs": "^3.1.0"


END NOTES:

I am grateful to the rentomojo folks for the assignment and in the making of the project this was my first ever hands on Web development and javascript. A day ago this all MEAN stack and APIs were fierce mountains for me to which i never visited spending a day trying to climb the peak i've developed interest, As the fact states i'm a quick learner i've sprinted myself from a novice to ninja in javascript The deployment , cascading styles and responsive React were the paths less travelled by me. I'll be zealing to them in the coming days and improving the apps functionality.

It was hectic for me to learn and build this in a single day span but i somehow managed. The shortcomings in the project will be met sooner than the soon.

Sources:
i've watched many tutorials and read some articles and blogs to cluster this project work through. Thus, there can be some innocent plagiarism. 

I'm proud that put the effort. (some basic webapp w/o deployment is still better than no participation)
[i'll soon be filing up the dots left empty]
